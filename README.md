# AIM

To create a React Single Page Application with protected routing using React Router, including Home, Login, and Dashboard pages with nested routes.

# PROCEDURE

Create a new React project using Vite.

Install react-router-dom for routing.

Create pages: Home, Login, Dashboard, Profile, Settings, Notifications.

Set up React Router with nested routes inside the Dashboard.

Implement fake authentication using localStorage (login, logout, isLoggedIn).

Create a ProtectedRoute component to block unauthorized access.

Wrap dashboard routes inside ProtectedRoute.

Design a sidebar in Dashboard for navigation between nested pages.

Test the app by logging in, navigating pages, and checking route protection.

# Output:
## Home:
<img width="1914" height="719" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1452e3e-664d-4f1a-8dd6-17e248bfd99c" />

## Dashboard:
<img width="1917" height="549" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bec48fb0-5dcd-4ac4-974f-9f3067e220f2" />

# RESULT

A fully functional SPA was developed where only logged-in users can access nested dashboard pages, and navigation works smoothly through protected and public routes.
